# AMS210-Jacobi

Coding helper program for students taking AMS 210: Applied Linear Algebra at Stony Brook University in Spring 2021.

The driver is for Homework #6, Section 3.4,  Problem 11a),b),c).

The program solves a system of linear equations using Jacobi iterations with error up to epsilon.

Feel free to use a Jupyter notebook or an online python interpreter like https://replit.com/languages/python3.

jacobi.py and jacobi-notebook.ipynb are the same. jacobi-notebook.ipynb is in a jupypter notebook format.
